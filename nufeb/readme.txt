Darren's code directory
=======================

Some initial messing around with shoving cells around as they grow and divide in the Python directory.

Some inital code for looking at agglomeration processes in the Scala directory. 

Also in the Scala directory, some better (functional) code for shoving cells as they grow, divide and die, in 3d. Note that the Scala code is very simple and short, and that Scala code is very easy to compile and run on any system with Java installed - see the readme in the Scala directory for futher details.
