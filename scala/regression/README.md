Scala Examples
==============


This code should work on any system with a recent version of Java installed.

The code uses "sbt" as the build tool. The sbt launcher has been included in the repo for the benefit of those new to Scala. It should be possible to run sbt from this directory by typing:

sbt

on Windows (which should run "sbt.bat"), or

./sbt.sh

on Linux and similar systems.

Assuming this works, just typing "run" at the sbt prompt will compile and run the code. Typing "test" will compile and run the tests. Typing "console" will give a Scala REPL with a properly configured class path. Type "help" at the sbt prompt for help on sbt. Type ":help" at the Scala REPL for help on the REPL.
